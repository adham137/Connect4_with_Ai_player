# Connect4_with_Ai_player
this project is an attempt to create a simple GUI for Connect Four board game, Also implement an AI player to play against the user using minimax algorithm optimised using alpha beta pruning

# Future improvements
* Code refactoring for better code understandability and feature addition.
* Utilize multi-threading for better perfromance, perhaps even use the GPU for ultra-mega-giga perfromance ?!
  * Checking for a winner in a parallel fashion (checking rows, columns, diagonals).
  * Calculating the heuristic value for each node ( since we need to check rows, columns, diagonals)
